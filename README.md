# ReactJs for Beginners
Its my first contribution to github, I will try to keep it improving

Install nodejs from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ (if you do not have already)

Just download this code at your disk https://github.com/humblesami/react-beginner.git

Open terminal/command prompt, navigate to the directory where you downloaded it

Give following two commands

1. npm install

2. npm start

Open browser and open this link http://localhost:8080

That's it

I am also a beginner with react, I faced losts of difficulty to find/run a simple react tutorial for beginner.
So I thought to help others who face diffculty in this.
